# ecog_pinch
ECoG data comparing pinch with individual finger flexion

This repository contains all the MATLAB functions necessary to reproduce the analysis and figures
included in the manuscript on spatial overlap between thumb-index pinch and individual finger 
flexion in patients with medically refractory epilepsy implanted with subdural electrocorticography
grids.
