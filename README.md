# ecog_pinch
ECoG data comparing pinch with individual finger flexion

This repository contains all the MATLAB functions necessary to reproduce the analysis and figures
included in the manuscript on spatial overlap between thumb-index pinch and individual finger 
flexion in patients with medically refractory epilepsy implanted with subdural electrocorticography
grids.

If you use the code in your publications, please cite the following bibliography:

  Potentials during pinching versus Thumb and index finger flexion." Neuroscience Letters (2024): 138062.
- Miller, K. J. (2019). A library of human electrocorticographic data and analyses. Nature human behaviour, 3(11), 1225-1235.

All the data used for analysis are available in the open access library, available at https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/zk881ps0522. 
The data are contained in the gestures folder. 

Please refer to the document in the repository titled "pk_sharing_statement" for more details on the data sharing agreement, 
the structure of the curated data and the pipeline for running the analysis on your personal computer.
